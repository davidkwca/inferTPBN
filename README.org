* inferTPBN -- Inferring Threshold Probabilistic Boolean Networks
  Generate synthetic Threshold Probabilistic Boolean networks and timeseries generated from these networks.

  This data can then be used to infer the best network given said data.

  Everything is (should be) compatible with any network generated via the BoolNet package.
